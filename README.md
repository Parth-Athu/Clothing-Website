👕 Clothing Website - "RRVP"

Welcome to our first college project — a Clothing Website named "RRVP"!  
The name "RRVP" comes from the initials of our team members:

- 🧑‍💻 Rahul  
- 👩‍💻 Reni  
- 👨‍💻 Vishwa  
- 👨‍💻 Parth  



📚 About the Project

This project was developed as part of our 1st semester coursework in the iMSc-IT (Cloud & Application Development) program at JG University.

The goal was to create a basic clothing e-commerce website that showcases products, brand style, and a user-friendly layout. It helped us learn and apply foundational concepts in web development.
